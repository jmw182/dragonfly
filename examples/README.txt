This folder contains ready to run modules in all supported languages. See the readme.txt file 
in each example folder for further instructions.

The examples with the same names are identical, so their modules written in different programming languages 
can be run together. For example, you could run Producer in cpp/producer_consumer together with Consumer in matlab/producer_consumer

On Windows, if you'd like to customize these examples, you may need to copy them to a folder where administrator privilidges 
are not required to save your modifications.
